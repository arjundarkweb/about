# Style and mechanics

We have an editorial style to help us keep our copy clear and consistent, and specific guidelines to write and structure content to make it easy for users to understand and act on.

Remember, we strive for [effectiveness over correctness](../content_guidelines/#effectiveness-over-correctness). Use these guidelines as a reference, not an authority, and always prioritize what's most effective for our target users.

## Abbreviations & acronyms

Avoid abbreviations and acronyms when possible.

**Yes**

- for example

**No**

- e.g.

**Further reading:**

- "[Acronyms Seriously Suck](https://gist.github.com/klaaspieter/12cd68f54bb71a3940eae5cdd4ea1764)" from Elon Musk.

### Latinisms

Avoid using Latinisms. Use complete English words for clarity.

**Yes**

- for example
- that is
- as opposed to
- through

**No**

- e.g.
- i.e.
- v.
- via

## Adverbs and adjectives

Try to avoid adjectives and adverbs. Using adjectives and adverbs (for example, it’s “easy” to get started with Sourcegraph) shapes perception and sets expectations, and can inadvertently lead to a negative emotional experience for our users. 

Instead, look for opportunities to capture the same meaning through other forms. What makes an “easy” book easy relative to other books? Can that be used as a scale of relative difficulty?

## Active voice vs. passive voice

Use active voice and avoid passive voice. In active voice, the subject of the sentence does the action. In passive voice, the subject of the sentence has the action done to it.

**Yes**

- Added book to list.

**No**

- The book was added to the list.

Use passive voice when you don’t want to assign responsibility for an action. This can reduce tension in a message.

**Yes**

- Email address was incorrect.

**No**

- Wrong email address provided.

The best way to determine if you’ve gone passive is to [check for zombies](https://twitter.com/johnsonr/status/259012668298506240?lang=en).

## Present tense

Use present tense to describe the result of actions.

**Yes**

- Book added

**No**

- Book has been added

## Capitalization

We use different forms of capitalization depending on the context.

For example, use title case for book names, and use sentence case for book descriptions. (If you’re not sure which capitalization to use, check the design system for existing conventions.)

All-caps should be used sparingly and only for specific purposes (all-caps copy is less accessible and harder to read). Never use all-caps within a sentence.

## Contractions

Use contractions like “we’ll” or “there’s!” They make our writing more conversational. 

However, don’t rely on contractions alone for a conversational voice.

## Conversational writing

Our voice is conversational. When we’re talking, we connect words with articles like “the,” “for,” “these,” and “an.” If we remove these from our writing, it makes our copy feel stiff and complicated. We can be flexible, though. If space is a limitation, the article can be omitted.

**Yes**

- Choose a book
- Save your changes

**No**

- Choose book
- Save changes

## Avoid directional language

Avoid any instructions or language that requires the user to see the layout or design of a page or element.

**Yes**

- Choose a new book.

**No**

- Choose a new book at the bottom right of this page.

## Numbers

Use the numeral when numbers appear in copy. This includes ordinals (numbers that tell the position of something in a list).

**Yes**

- You have 3 new recommendations
- 2 days left to share a recommendation
- This is your 3rd recommendation

**No**

- You have three new recommendations
- Two days left to share a recommendation
- This is your third recommendation

Numbers over 3 digits get commas.

**Yes**

- 144
- 1,200

### Dates

Spell out the day of the week and the month whenever possible. Abbreviate when space is a limitation. When abbreviated in interface headings and labels, do not use a period.

**Yes**

- Thursday, April 16  
- April 16  
- Apr 16

When possible, use natural language to describe dates.

**Yes**

- Today
- Yesterday
- Tomorrow
- This week
- Next week
- Two weeks from now

When date is written in numerals, the standard format is `YYYY-MM-DD`.

**Yes**

- 2020-09-08

**No**

- 08.09.2020
- 08-09-2020

### Percentages

Use the % symbol instead of spelling out “percent.”

**Yes**

- 2%

**No**

- Two percent

### Ranges and spans

Use an en dash (`–`) to indicate a range or span of numbers. Do not use spaces before and after the en dash.

**Yes**

- 10–20 minute read

An en dash is slightly wider than a hyphen (`-`) but narrower than an em dash (`—`).

### Money

When writing about US currency, use the dollar sign ($) before the amount. Omit the cents. Do not insert a space between the dollar sign and the number.

**Yes**

- $10

**No**

- $10.00
- $ 42

When writing about monthly pricing, follow the convention: $0/mo. Do not use spaces.

**Yes**

- $150/mo

**No*

- $150 / month
- $150/month
- $150/pm

Use shorthand suffixes for shortening numbers in the thousands (`k`), millions (`m`), billions (`b`), and above. Prefer lower case suffixes.

**Yes**

- $100b

**No**

- $100,000
- $100B
- $100Bn
- $100 billion

### Telephone numbers

Use dashes without spaces between numbers. Don’t use a country code.

**Yes**

- 123-456-7890

### Time

When writing about a time of the day, use numerals and lowercase am or pm, with a space in between. Use 12-hour time.

**Yes**

- 5 pm
- 8:30 pm

**No**

- 5pm
- 8:30PM

Use an en dash (`–`) between times to indicate a time period. Don’t insert spaces before and after the en dash.

**Yes**

- 8 am–12 pm 
- 6:30 am–18:00 pm

When referring to an amount of time, use numerals and the full word, with a space in between.

**Yes**

- Sent 20 minutes ago
- Received 30 seconds ago

## Punctuation

### Apostrophes

Apostrophes are usually used to make a word possessive. If the word already ends in an s and it’s singular, you also add an’s. If the word ends in an s and is plural, just add an apostrophe.

Watch out for dumb apostrophes (`'`). These are a relic of typewriters, and can be identified by how they’re straight rather than curly. Always use typographic apostrophes (`‘`).

**Yes**

- This recommendation’s new for you
- This book is Jen’s favourite
- Chris’s favourite book

### Colons

Use a colon to offset a list.

**Yes**

- This books is known for three things: aliens, adventure, and bad poetry.

When a list begins with an interface label, capitalize the first word of the list.

- Genres: Fantasy, science fiction, and humour.

### Commas

Prefer the Oxford or serial comma when writing a list.

**Yes**

- Common tropes include the big bad, Mordor, and spy speak.

**No**

- Common tropes include the big bad, Mordor and spy speak.

### Dashes and hyphens

Use a hyphen (`-`) without spaces before and after to link words into a single phrase.

**Yes**

- First-time reader?

Use an en dash (`–`) to indicate a [range or span](#ranges-and-spans), without spaces.

**Yes**

- 2–6 minute read

Use an em (`—`) dash without spaces to separate clauses in paragraph copy.

**Yes**

- This new series—a first in science fiction—is perfect for readers looking for bad poetry.

### Ellipses

Use ellipses to indicate that a line of copy has been clipped before the end. This is typically used when only a single line of copy will fit, but the content itself is too long. Avoid this when possible.

When ellipses are used to clip a line of copy, clip after at least 2 characters.

**Yes**

- Harry Potter and the Go…

**No**

- Harry Potter and the G…

### Periods

Use periods in complete sentences. Don’t use periods in headlines or labels. Periods go inside quotation marks. They go outside parentheses ( ) when the contained text is part of a larger sentence, and inside when the contained text stands alone.

**Yes**

- 3 books on your list
- We’ve updated the results to display only your selected languages (English, German).

**No**

- 3 meals in your box.

### Quotation marks

Watch out for dumb quotation marks (`'` and `"`). These are a relic of typewriters, and can be identified by how they’re straight rather than curly. Always use typographic quotation marks (`‘` and `’`, `“` and `”`).

**Yes**

- ‘Example’
- “Example Two”

**No**

- 'Example'
- "Example two"

### Slashes

Don't use spaces between two terms separated by a slash. 

**Yes**

- tool/editor

**No**

- tool / editor

## Places

Spell out all city names. 

When written in paragraph copy, write out country, state, and province names on the first mention. On subsequent mentions, abbreviating is fine.

**Yes**

- Now available in Winnipeg.

**No**

- Now available in WPG.

## Positive vs. negative

Use positive language rather than negative language. Positives are easier to read and process than negatives. One way to detect negative language is to look for words like “can’t,” “don’t,” etc.

**Yes**

- Update your payment method to access your account.

**No**

- If you don’t update your payment method, you won’t be able to access your account.

## Use positive words when talking about positive things

If a sentence begins with a negative word, the sentence’s implication can be misinterpreted as negative.

**Yes**

- Remember to save your new payment method

**No**

- Don’t forget to save your new payment method

## Writing questions

A common error when writing questions is not constructing the sentence as a question. Usually, this can be fixed by changing the word order.

**Yes**

- Why does “Dune” deserve a re-read?

**No**

- Why “Dune” deserves a re-read?

## Writing about ourselves

We describe ourselves with a few different names depending on context, and we should use the right term at the right time.

- **Sourcegraph**: Main product. Prefer using this name unless you need to be more precise.
- **Self-hosted Sourcegraph instance**: Only if clarification between Sourcegraph Cloud, managed instances, and on-premises instances is required.
- **Managed Sourcegraph instance**: Only if clarification between the Sourcegraph Cloud instance, self-hosted instances, and managed instances is required.
- **Sourcegraph Server**: The public instance of Sourcegraph for open source code at [sourcegraph.com](https://sourcegraph.com).
- **Sourcegraph integrations**: The general term for our integrations. When referencing specific integrations:
    - Sourcegraph(’s) Phabricator integration
    - Sourcegraph(’s) GitHub integration
    - Sourcegraph(’s) browser extensions
    - Sourcegraph(’s) Chrome extension
    - Sourcegraph(’s) Firefox add-on
- **Sourcegraph OSS**: When referring to the build result of the open source repository.

You don't need to use the full name of the product each time you refer to it, but don't use a shortened name that could be confused with an official name.

**Yes**

- Use the Phabricator integration to get Sourcegraph features in code review.

**No**

- Use the Sourcegraph Phabricator integration to get Sourcegraph features in code review (_sounds repetitive and stilted_).

Always title case our name. Don’t abbreviate or add a space to our name.

**Yes**

- Sourcegraph

**No**

- SG
- Source Graph

Only use _we_ and _our_ (as in “our GitHub integration”) in informal documents. In documentation or marketing material, depending on the context, just avoid it, or use “the” or “Sourcegraph”. 

### Feature names

Don’t capitalize descriptive product or feature names. Features are not proper nouns. Avoid phrasing that can imply official product names.

**Yes**

- Use the Phabricator integration to...
- Want to use this in your code review tool? Use Sourcegraph’s [GitHub integration](#_).
- Here’s how to use campaigns.

**No**

- Use the Phabricator Integration to... (_the capital “I” makes it into a proper noun, which implies it’s a separate product from “Sourcegraph Phabricator integration.”_)
- Want to use this in your code review tool? Use [Sourcegraph for GitHub](#_). (_Implies that “Sourcegraph for GitHub” is an official product name._)
- Here’s how to use Campaigns.

Use the natural plural/singular form. If a feature name is a plural noun, treat it as a plural noun.

**Yes**

- Campaigns are available.

**No**

- Campaigns is available.

Refer to the natural noun of the product feature directly.

**Yes**

- Campaigns are available.

**No**

- The campaigns feature is available.

Qualify feature names with `Sourcegraph $FEATURE` (and capitalize the feature name) only on marketing pages and only when needed (never in product documentation, in-product text).

## Writing about people

We design and build our platforms with a human-centered point of view. Whenever we write something for our digital platforms, we need to write in a way that’s compassionate, inclusive, and respectful.

Here are some specific guidelines for how we write about people.

### Disability

Avoid disability-related idioms like “lame” or “falling on deaf ears.”

Default to person-first language rather than identity-first language.

**Yes**

- they have a disability
- person with disability
- people living with disabilities

**No**

- they are disabled
- disabled person

Do not use the term “edge cases” to describe users living with disabilities. This term further marginalizes people already living on the margins. Instead, use the term “stress cases.”

### Gender and sexuality

Don’t call groups of people “guys.” Don’t call women “girls.” 

Avoid gendered terms.

**Yes**

- Artisan

**No**

- Craftsman

It’s okay to use “they” as a singular pronoun. If there’s no inherent purpose to specifying a gender, default to “they.”

### Hearing

Use lower-case “deaf,” “hard of hearing,” or “hearing loss” as adjectives to describe someone with hearing loss.

### Vision

Use lower-case “blind” to describe someone who is unable to see. Use “low vision” or “vision loss” as adjectives to describe a person with limited vision.

## Avoid words with multiple meanings

Some words to watch out for:

**Once** (could mean “one time,” “after,” “in the past,” or “when”)

**Yes**

- After you’ve made your picks

**No**

- Once you’ve made your picks

**Right** (could mean “correct,” “the opposite of left,” “politically conservative,” etc.)

**Yes**

- Pick the book you like most

**No**

- Pick the right book

**Since** (could refer to a point in time, or a synonym of “because”)

**Yes**

- Because you have a referral already, you can invite a friend and get a free month

**No**

- Since you already have a referral, you can invite a friend and get a free month

**“Require” plus an infinitive** (could confuse the relationship between subject and object)

**Yes**

- Referrals can be sent from any Foreword account.

**No**

- A Foreword account is required to send referrals. _(This could imply that both the sender and receiver have to have a Foreword account to send a referral.)_

## Avoid idioms

In most languages, idioms are commonly-known phrases packed with meaning. However, idioms don’t often translate into other languages. They can also create confusion for translators that have English as an additional language. It’s better to avoid using idioms at all.

**Yes**

- Let’s get started
- This information might change

**No**

- Let’s get crackin’
- Take this with a grain of salt
